                    <h4 class="Cyber_Answer">Simply put, cybersecurity is protection of computer systems. As the world moves towards being more and more connected online, the tasks performed by computers grows, the usage of computers grows, and the amount of data produced grows. Some of this data is important to be kept private, but as more computers are used in the world, there are more computer hackers as well. The more important computers are, the more targeted they become. </h4>

                    <br>
                    <h4 class="Cyber_Answer">This is why Cybersecurity is so important. Data that used to never be online is now online. This could include important company documents, trade secrets, weapons designs, missile technology designs, and many more things. It is increasingly more important to keep sensitive data private. This is the focus of Cybersecurity. </h4>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="Cyber_Answer">There are many sub-categories of cybersecurity. Analysts look at a system for anything that is missing, or any evident faults. Penetration Testers act as a hacker would, and try to break into a system in order to discover a vulnerability. Cybersecurity Engineers design the basis for a new secure system. All of these roles and people work together to create a secure system for a company. </h4>
